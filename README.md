## Overview

### What's the problem

In any pandemic (recently COVID) or post disaster (like cyclone, major earthquake), reliable Blood supply becomes critical for saving human lives. More so as blood cannot be manufactured, only provided by volunteer donors.

Even in normal times the blood deficit is common problem across the globe. India alone requires approx. 12 million units but only 9 million units are available every year, and during crisis, the demand to supply gap worsens further.

For example, for plasma treatment during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis or during the recent super cyclone in WB and Odisha, many people have suffered due to lack of information about donors or available blood stock. The information is not sufficiently structured or reliable to enable rapid discovery of help needed.

What is needed is a solution that empowers citizens to easily connect and access this information for need of Blood.

### How can technology help

An efficient collaboration based on Blockchain network and cloud service powered the Mobile & Web interfaces can help in addressing the current Blood donation challenges -

1. Lack of collaboration among blood banks
2. Lack of Transparency among the Donors , Receivers & banks.
3. Safe blood transfusions
4. Lack of common shared IT network among the blood banks
5. Lack of accessibility of data of blood stock

## The idea

The goal is -

1. To provide a mobile application for Blood Donor to donate & Receiver to find blood available in hospital in your nearest locality and guide them to the appropriate locations.
2. Build a common and shared blood bank blockchian network which will be used by Blood bank , Hospital , Donor , Receiver , NGO , Red cross.
3. Centralized Report for government to track and analyze the blood stock and run focused blood donation schemes
4. Increase blood donation through different initiatives and donor incentives.

### Benefits

The IBM Cloud service (Watson Assistant, Blockchain) can benefit below -

#### Block Chain benefits

1. Bring Transparency in available Blood stock across Blood Banks, Red cross.
2. Bring trust among the Blood Bank , Donor and Receiver.
3. Block Chain provides immutable records â€“ which means blood related transactions cannot be altered.
   1. Ensure that the patient gets safe blood by tracking the history of blood bag and expiry of blood bag.
   1. Block donor with disease history to donate blood.
   1. Fraudulent activities can be eliminated.
   1. Unauthorized blood bags and spurious blood can be detected easily.
   1. Contamination can be traced to the source due to the immutable audit trail.

#### Benefit to Donor

1. Unified blood donation history across blood banks for Donors.
2. With digitization, donors can avail donation benefits without having to register and donate under multiple organizations.
3. Donor can register to get alerts and reminders for upcoming blood donation drive.

#### Benefit to Recipient

1. Instant identification of blood bank with available blood stock.
2. Use of contaminated or unauthorized blood bag prevented.

#### Benefit to Hospitals

1. Easy access to available blood stock by Hospitals, Nursing Homes, etc.
2. Blood stock can be managed across Blood Banks.
3. Inter-district and inter-state surplus blood stock transfer possible instead of getting expired.

#### Benefit to Govt and NGOs

1. Govt., NGOs can use the data for planning drives and reward/appreciation for donors.
2. Contaminated blood can be traced to the originating blood bank. Regular offenders can be blacklisted.
3. Reports can be used by Govt. for any corrective action and/or sanction.

#### Affiliate benefits

1. Donors can Search and book for blood test in case of identification of blood related disease from donation history.
2. During family emergency, users can donate in City A and avail benefit in City B.
3. Reward points for blood donation that can be redeemed through affiliate services like blood tests and medical check ups

## How it works

1. The Blood Donor, who want to Donate blood or want to register for blood donation open the User Mobile application and fills out the brief form and submit the detail. This information is stored in the database in the IBM Cloud. The Donor can fill the nearest Blood donation center where he want to donate the blood.

2. The Blood Bank/Hospital can access the Donor detail and contact them for collecting the blood. After the testing of the blood completed the Blood bag detail and the Donor detail in stored in Blockchain network.

3. The Blood Recipient, who need the blood , open the mobile application and use the chat interface to locate the Blood Bank/Hospital where the blood is available. Incase the blood is not available, They can submit Emergency blood need form via the Hospital approval application. The Donor will be mail/SMS and if the Donor agree to donate blood the Recipient and Donor can locate each other for blood donation.

## Diagrams

### The architecture

![Cooperation architecture diagram](/images/architecture-diagram.png)

1. Blood Donor/Receiver use the mobile app for voluntary blood donation, receiver can finding donor, hospital for blood availability.
2. User can ask questions to Watson Assistant and get answers on blood and voluntary donor availability questions.
3. Authorized Hospital or Blood Bank can obtain geolocation data to plot routes to collect (or drop off) supplies using HERE Location Services.
